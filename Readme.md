## Issues (or Wiki?) üì®

#### Custom client id and client secrets for Google drive upload:

**Written by:** [patheticGeek](https://github.com/patheticGeek) for [the original project](https://github.com/patheticGeek/torrent-aio-bot)

1. Go to https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/quickstart/nodejs and click on Enable the Drive API. Copy client id and set an enviorment variable in heroku with name CLIENT_ID then copy client secret and set another env named CLIENT_SECRET.
2. Goto https://\<project name>.herokuapp.com/drivehelp and paste your client id and secret and click "Get auth code", it will redirect you to login and you'll get a auth code after login paste that auth code in the auth code feild and click "Generate token" it'll give you a token. now set these as env variable CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, AUTH_CODE and TOKEN.
3. By default files are uploaded in the root of drive if you dont want to upload in root folder make a folder copy its id and set a env var GDRIVE_PARENT_FOLDER and value id of desired folder. The folder id will be the last part of the url such as in url "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rpk7tGWs_lv_kZ_W4EPaKj8brfFVLOH-" the folder id is "1rpk7tGWs_lv_kZ_W4EPaKj8brfFVLOH-".
4. If you want team drive support open your teamdrive and copy the folder id from url eg. https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0ABZHZpfYfdVCUk9PVA this is link of a team drive copy the last part "0ABZHZpfYfdVCUk9PVA" this will be your GDRIVE_PARENT_FOLDER. If you want them in a folder in teamdrive open the folder and use that folder's id instead.
5. You're good to go. The gdrive status will be shown in "gdrive.txt" file when you click Open on the website downloads page. Bot wil automatically send you drive link when its uploaded.

> Use this torrent for testing or when downloading to setup drive it is well seeded and downloads in ~10s

#### Changing the sites used for searching

**Written by:** [patheticGeek](https://github.com/patheticGeek) for [the original project](https://github.com/patheticGeek/torrent-aio-bot)
   
To change the pirate bay site, visit the site you would like to use search something there, copy the url eg. https://thepiratebay.org/search/whatisearched and replace the search with {term} so the url looks like https://thepiratebay.org/search/{term} ans set this to env var `PIRATEBAY_SITE`

Same, if you want to change the limetorrents site visit the site you want to use and search for something, then replace the thing you searched for with {term} so final url looks like https://limetorrents.at/search?search={term} and set this value to env var `LIMETORRENT_SITE`

Simillarly the enviorment variable for 1337x is `O337X_SITE`

#### Search feature isn't working:

**Written by:** [Itz-fork](https://github.com/Itz-fork) for [the unofficial clone](https://github.com/Itz-fork/Torrent-Aio-Bot-Duplicate)

Follow these steps üëá,
  - Fork this repo and connect it to your heroku app
  - Add the following buildpack to your heroku app (click to copy)
    - ```
        https://github.com/jontewks/puppeteer-heroku-buildpack.git
      ```
  - Redeploy your heroku app

If the search feature still isn't working try checking your heroku apps [Configs](#configs-)

> Note ‚ö†Ô∏è : The search feature is currently unmaintained due to the inconsistency between proxy sites and their uptimes
